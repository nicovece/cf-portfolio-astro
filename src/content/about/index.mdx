I’m a full-stack web developer with a long background in digital product design and front-end development.

For the last 20 years, I’ve been designing and building digital products—websites, booking tools, e-commerce solutions, and custom client platforms—where design, functionality, and code all had to ship reliably. I wrote the HTML/CSS/JavaScript, worked in PHP/WordPress environments, shaped UI and UX, translated product requirements, and solved production issues.

In 2025, I completed an intensive 8-month full-stack program, adding formal training in modern web technologies: React and Angular on the frontend, Node.js/Express and Python/Django on the backend, RESTful APIs, relational and NoSQL databases, and modern testing practices.

## From digital product work to full-stack development

I didn’t “switch” from design to development—I’ve been doing both since the mid-2000s. Over the years I’ve:

- Designed and implemented marketing sites, booking platforms, and e-commerce solutions.
- Written production HTML/CSS/JavaScript and worked within PHP/WordPress setups.
- Translated product and business requirements into working, maintainable interfaces.

What changed recently is that I decided to **formalise and deepen the engineering side**, especially on the backend and architecture. That’s why I took a structured full-stack program focused on React, Angular, Node/Express, Django, databases, and testing, and rebuilt my portfolio around real web projects instead of just static case studies.

## How I work (and what I bring)

I like working end-to-end: understanding the problem, designing or refining the UX, and then implementing the solution in code.

I care about:

- **Product thinking** – starting from user needs and business constraints, not just features.
- **User experience** – clear flows, accessible interfaces, and content that actually makes sense.
- **Clean implementation** – solid HTML/CSS, component-based UIs, and code that other people can read.
- **Shipping reliably** – working iteratively, testing, and keeping an eye on production behaviour.

What I bring that most early-career full-stack developers don’t:

- 20 years of professional experience shipping client-facing products.
- Senior-level front-end and UI implementation skills.
- Comfort bridging design, frontend, and backend.
- A “figure it out” mindset: I’m used to owning problems and making sure things work in production.

## Tech snapshot

**Senior-level (front-end & product)**

- HTML5, CSS3, responsive layouts, modern CSS (Flex/Grid), SASS/SCSS
- JavaScript (frontend fundamentals, DOM, modules, async/promises/fetch)
- UI/UX implementation, design systems, component libraries
- Git/GitHub workflows, working with designers and stakeholders

**Early-career (modern frameworks & backend)**

- React, Angular, TypeScript
- Node.js / Express
- Python / Django
- PostgreSQL & SQLite via ORMs, MongoDB/Mongoose
- RESTful APIs, testing practices (Jest, Cucumber, Puppeteer)
- Tailwind, npm, Vite/Parcel

**Background / legacy**

- jQuery, PHP/WordPress, Bootstrap (legacy v3), Firebase, React Native (exposure)

## What I’m looking for

I’m looking for a permanent full-stack or front-end web developer role in Berlin (early-career on the backend, senior on the front-end).

Ideally:

- A stable, product-focused team rather than an early-stage startup.
- English-first or international environment.
- A place where I can contribute immediately on the frontend and grow on the backend through code reviews and collaboration.
- Modern web or AI/agentic products, where strong fundamentals and curiosity matter more than a specific framework.
