**Flicktionary Angular Client** is a modern, single-page web application built for movie enthusiasts to explore, search, and manage information about films, genres, directors, and personal user profiles.

Developed with **Angular**, **TypeScript**, and **Angular Material**, the app delivers a responsive and accessible interface optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.

Users can browse a catalog of movies, view detailed film data in interactive dialogs, and filter results by genre or director. Registered users can create accounts, log in, manage profiles, and curate a list of favorite movies, with the ability to update their information and remove saved items.

The client communicates with a **RESTful API** backend using **RxJS** for real-time data flow and leverages Angular’s modular architecture for maintainability and performance. Additional features include unit testing with **Karma** and **Jasmine**, **TypeDoc-generated documentation**, and a fully modular codebase built for scalability and reusability.
