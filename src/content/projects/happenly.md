**Happenly** is a smart, user-friendly event companion designed to help users discover, filter, and visualize events that matter most to them. Built with React, Vite, and SCSS, the app offers a responsive and accessible interface where users can search events by city, control how many are displayed, and expand listings for more detail. Features like real-time search suggestions, interactive charts (via Recharts), and offline access enhance usability, while accessibility support—including keyboard navigation and ARIA announcements—ensures an inclusive experience. Powered by a custom backend with Google Calendar integration via a Node.js AWS Lambda function, **Happenly is fully installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA)**, providing a native-like experience on any device—even offline. Whether planning ahead or just browsing, Happenly makes event exploration seamless and engaging.
