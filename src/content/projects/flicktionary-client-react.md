A powerful search and filter system allows exploration by title, genre, actor, or director, while favorites functionality helps users curate personal watchlists. Data is fetched from a custom RESTful API with secure authentication, and the app architecture is modular, efficient, and optimized for performance.

Whether run locally or accessed online, Flicktionary makes movie discovery smooth, engaging, and fun.
