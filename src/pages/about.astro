	<h3>Ciao, io sono Nico.</h3>
	<p>
			I had design training but learned development on my own. The topics are becoming more interesting yet
			increasingly complicated to study independently.
	</p>
	<p>
			I remain committed to expanding my expertise to serve others better through a Full-Stack developer
			course.
	</p>
	<p>
			My career has been a proud journey of continuous growth. After gaining design knowledge at university, I
			found a mentor who guided my training as a graphic designer. During this period, I developed a passion
			for web development.
	</p>
	<p>
			After three years, my mentor invited me to partner in his firm, where I managed the web and digital
			department, gaining expertise in both design and development.
	</p>
	<p>Ã¥
			In 2012, I left the partnership to freelance as a consultant, and I'm pleased that many collaborations
			have continued since then, significantly enhancing my development skills through diverse projects.
